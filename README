I Like Turtles
==============

I was playing Minecraft with my work friends and discovered that there is a mod which adds
code controlled bots (turtles) that can do most things a player can.  My mind went wild with
ideas for procedurally built cities, megastructures, and terraformed lands all done with the
materials pulled from recursive mining patterns and self sustaining colonies of robots.

OMG Turtles.

Anyway, a lot of this code is pretty unusable and bad right now because I've been in a rush to
get something working.  dstarlite.lua has an implementation of D* Lite (By [Sven Koenig](http://idm-lab.org/project-a.html)).
It works in testing and I'm currently in the process of making a test script I can run in game.
